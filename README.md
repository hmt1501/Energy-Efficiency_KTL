# Linear Regression Training Project: Energy

This study looked into assessing the cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters. Cooling load (Cooling load) is the amount of heat that must be removed from a space to maintain the desired temperature and humidity levels during hot weather. It is measured in units of kW (kilowatts) or Btu/h (British thermal units per hour).

We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. 

We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses.
